# GSM-Based Weather Monitoring System

This project proposes a wireless weather monitoring system using GSM technology to transmit sensor data to a user via SMS. It captures temperature, light, and humidity readings and sends them automatically.

## Key Features

- **Wireless communication**: Utilizes GSM module for remote data transmission.
- **Sensor data**: Measures temperature, light, and humidity for comprehensive weather monitoring.
- **Automatic reporting**: Sends sensor readings to the user via SMS without manual intervention.
- **Microcontroller-based**: Employs an Atmega microcontroller for data processing and communication.

## Hardware Components

- **Atmega Microcontroller** (e.g., ATmega328P)
- **DHT11 Digital Temperature and Humidity Sensor**
- **LDR Sensor 5MM Photoresistor** (for light detection)
- **SIM800L GSM Module**
- **Crystal Oscillator** (frequency depends on microcontroller)
- **Resistors** (various values for sensor biasing and circuit protection)
- **Capacitors** (various values for power supply filtering and signal stabilization)
- **Transistors** (optional, depending on circuit requirements)
- **Cables and Connectors**
- **Diodes** (optional, depending on circuit requirements)
- **PCB or Breadboard** for prototyping
- **LED** (optional, for visual indication)
- **Power Supply** (Transformer/Adapter)
- **Push Buttons** (optional, for user interaction)
- **Switch** (optional, for power control)
- **ICs** (optional, depending on circuit design)
- **IC Sockets** (optional, for easy component replacement)

## Software Requirements

- **Arduino IDE** (Integrated Development Environment)
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Required Libraries**:
  - SoftwareSerial (for serial communication with GSM module)
  - LiquidCrystal (for LCD display, if used)
  - DHT (for DHT11 sensor communication)

## Getting Started

### Hardware Setup

1. Assemble the circuit according to a schematic diagram (not provided in this repository).
2. Ensure proper connections between sensors, microcontroller, and GSM module.
3. Power the system using a suitable power supply.

### Software Development

1. Install the Arduino IDE if not already done.
2. Download the required libraries (SoftwareSerial, LiquidCrystal, DHT).
3. Refer to the library documentation for detailed usage instructions.
4. Develop the C code to:
   - Initialize sensors and GSM module.
   - Read sensor data (temperature, light, humidity).
   - Process and format the data for SMS transmission.
   - Send the data via SMS using the GSM module (refer to SIM800L documentation for AT commands).

## Additional Notes

- This README provides a general overview. Specific implementation details may vary depending on your chosen components and desired functionalities.
- Consult datasheets and tutorials for the microcontroller, sensors, and GSM module for in-depth configuration and usage information.
- Consider incorporating error handling and debugging mechanisms in your code for robustness.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement data logging to store sensor readings on an SD card or cloud storage.
- Develop a user interface (e.g., LCD display) to show real-time sensor data locally.
- Integrate with weather forecasting services for more comprehensive weather reporting.
